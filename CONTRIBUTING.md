your feedback.

## Testing the Development Version

If you want to use the latest development version of Pondus and help
finding new bugs or other problems, you can get the latest version from
<https://github.com/enicklas/pondus/> or, if you have Git installed,
type `git clone https://github.com/enicklas/pondus.git`. This version can be
tested without installation by executing `pondus.py`.

## Translating

You can help other people using Pondus by translating it from English to
another language. Instructions how to do so can be found in `po/README`.

## Contributing Code

If you want to implement a feature yourself, we will be happy to accept
patches sent to us via the mailing list. Alternatively, you can fork the
project at <https://github.com/enicklas/pondus/> and ask me to pull the
changes.
