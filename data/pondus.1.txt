NAME

pondus - personal weight manager for GTK+2


SYNOPSIS
--------
*pondus* [options]


OPTIONS
-------
--version::
    show program's version number and exit

-h, --help::
    show a help message and exit

-i FILE, --input=FILE::
    read data from FILE instead of the standard location


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Pondus is a personal weight manager that keeps track of your body
weight and, optionally, the percentage of bodyfat, muscle and water.
It aims to be simple to use, lightweight and fast. All data
can be plotted to get a quick overview of the history of your weight.
A simple weight planner allows one to define ``target weights'' and this
plan can be compared with the actual measurements in a plot.

By default, the user data is stored in ~/.pondus/user_data.xml and is
written to this file automatically on exit, so you don't have to worry
about saving the data you entered.

All functionality is available via the toolbar or via keyboard/mouse
shortcuts. The following shortcuts are currently used:

CTR-a::                         add new dataset
CTR-d, Delete::                 delete selected dataset
CTR-e, Return, Double-click::   edit selected dataset
CTR-p::                         plot weight vs time
CTR-q::                         quit pondus

To improve the workflow, the add dialog is initialized with the current
date and the last measured weight. Both date and weight can be
incremented/decremented by one day/0.1kg(lbs) by pressing ``+'' or
``-'', respectively. Pressing ``Enter'' in one of the entry fields is a
shortcut for clicking the ``OK''-button.

A simple weight planner allows you to define future ``target weights'',
i.e. the weight you want to have at some future date. After enabling
the weight planner in the preferences, a selector at the bottom of the
main window determines whether you are currently editing the weight
measurements or the weight plan.

The im-/export dialogs allow to im-/export weight data from/to
other applications such as SportsTracker or any program supporting
CSV of the form `2008-03-26,81.3`.
