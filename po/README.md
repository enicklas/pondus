# Translations for Pondus

## Create a new translation

Run `msginit` in `po/` and follow the instructions. This requires an 
installation of `gettext`.

Alternatively, you can also copy `pondus.pot` to `LL.po` (where LL is
your language code) and edit the header manually.

Translate the strings and submit the resulting `LL.po` to as a pull request
on <https://github.com/enicklas/pondus>.

## Updating existing translations

Edit an existing `.po` file and submit the changes as a pull request
on <https://github.com/enicklas/pondus>.
